# Lesson 4 Notes

### Dashed (Explicit): Lines we have created using rows or columns (solid lines: where explicit starts and stops)

### Dotted (Implicit) Track: Lines that were generated by the browswer when we created rows or columns 

------

# Lesson 5 Notes

**Implicit** 
- Browser has created for you

***Explicit** 
- You have created (black line in mozilla)

### Adding Items 

When we add the 5 and 6th box, even though we have two rows the browser will make a third row and put the extra items there (implicit row)

### grid-auto-rows

- This property enables you style 'the extra' elements (5 and 6th box) and style them implicitly 
- All other items that do not fit inside the second row (which user created) style them implicitly (like 5 and 6), so if we add more items (7 and 8) they too will be 200px
